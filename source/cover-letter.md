Dear Hiring Committee,

During my tenure at PlanetScale, I managed dozens of Kubernetes clusters and my responsibilities included the orchestration layer of the PlanetScale database platform. This role demanded a deep understanding of backend functionality, requiring the development of performant, maintainable code and robust system health management—capabilities that align seamlessly with the responsibilities outlined for this position.

#### Relevant Experience

At PlanetScale, my responsibilities included orchestrating the complete lifecycle of sharded MySQL databases across a multi-tenant, multi-cloud environment, using Vitess and Kubernetes. This experience has honed my skills in managing infrastructure essential for supporting scalable products, aligning with the strategic and tactical goals of the company for uptime and reliability. Select work included:

- Creation of VTOrc resources and a move to semi-synchronous replication for tens of thousands of MySQL databases, enhancing data durability and the robustness of replication while increasing uptime.

- Adding feature flags and observability to database reconciliation processes, which allowed for more dynamic and efficient database management.

- Introducing Vitess versioning lifecycle management across our infrastructure, improving our version rollout deployment strategy and forwards/backwards compatibility.

- Modifying Kubernetes operator code to upgrade and rollout dozens of etcd clusters, ensuring our clusters remain highly available and maintainable.

- Converting container images to Wolfi images, achieving smaller, more secure containers with faster boot times.

- Creation of admin tools (web-based admin application & CLI tooling) for managing database infrastructure, streamlining the process of database creation and management.

Percy.io (acquired by BrowserStack) tasked me with leading the architecture and maintenance of infrastructure for a screenshot capture & testing platform. My work involved enhancing snapshot rendering speeds and developing new customer-facing features to improve user interaction. Select work included:

- General support & maintenance of infrastructure via Helm and Terraform.

- Migrating high-traffic Redis infrastructure to mTLS without skipping a beat.

- Implementing complete observability for the rendering pipeline and screenshot capture.

- Adding shadow snapshot rendering to confidently upgrade the critical rendering path without image snapshot divergence.

- Developing a routing mesh and stateless snapshot rendering jobs infrastructure, leveraging Knative for efficient, containerized rendering tasks.

- Implementing high-throughput HTTPS caching for an asset-rewriting interception proxy, utilizing serverless workers for improved performance and scalability.

- Crafting browser extensions to enhance snapshot manipulation and request observation, streamlining the product functionality.

#### What I’m Looking for in My Next Role

##### Customer-centric clarity of focus

I've been focusing on developer tools, which makes customer empathy easy. Nonetheless, I have been laser-focused on improving the customer experience for customers for years now. By focusing on eliminating paper cuts and simplifying infrastructure wherever possible, I've been aiming to increase the quality of the product while simultaneously reducing the scope of technical support & maintenance required. Soliciting direct feedback from existing customers is essential to understanding how the current product meets their needs and/or falls short.

##### Autonomy & trust

I've been able to set my own milestones and define projects for myself for years, and it’s been truly liberating. It allows me to holistically approach customers’ needs and tackle the necessary infrastructure projects without need of a two-week iteration period. I've been managing a queue of work for myself with little guidance from my manager and have a proven track record of getting work done and doing it well.

##### Growth mindset

Does the company actively look for ways to reduce friction and help set up employees for a great outcome? How does the team on-boarding, equipment and tooling, and culture of regular feedback compare to the industry-leading companies? Does the company encourage my growth and career trajectory?

##### Growing together

Teams fostering discussion of differing opinions can profoundly impact product decisions. A high-functioning environment benefits from a culture promoting kindness, open communication, and straight talk. Team discussions and retrospectives prove invaluable for assessing strengths and identifying areas for improvement. These practices contribute to a more effective and collaborative workplace. My experience in managing complex infrastructure, coupled with my passion for customer-centric solutions and continuous improvement, aligns well with the challenges and opportunities this role presents. I'm excited about the prospect of contributing to a team that values open communication, fosters growth, and strives for excellence in product development.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills in Kubernetes management, database orchestration, and infrastructure optimization could benefit your team's objectives. I'd love to explore how we could work together to enhance your product's performance, scalability, and user experience.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of speaking with you to delve deeper into how I can contribute to your team's success.

Thanks,

Faun
