Dear Hiring Committee,

During my tenure at PlanetScale, I managed many Kubernetes clusters and was responsible for the orchestration layer of the PlanetScale database platform. This role demanded a deep understanding of backend functionality, requiring the development of performant, maintainable code and robust system health management—capabilities that align seamlessly with the responsibilities outlined for this position.

### Relevant Experience

At PlanetScale, my responsibilities included orchestrating the complete lifecycle of sharded MySQL databases across a multi-tenant, multi-cloud environment, using Vitess and Kubernetes. This experience has honed my skills in managing infrastructure essential for supporting scalable products, aligning with the strategic and tactical goals of the company for uptime and reliability. Select work included:

- Creation of VTOrc resources and a move to semi-synchronous replication for many tens of thousands of MySQL databases, significantly enhancing data durability and the robustness of replication while increasing uptime.

- Adding feature flags and observability to database reconciliation processes, which allowed for more dynamic and efficient database management.

- Introducing Vitess versioning lifecycle management across our infrastructure, improving our version rollout deployment strategy and forwards/backwards compatibility.

- Modifying Kubernetes operator code to upgrade and rollout dozens of etcd clusters, ensuring our clusters remain highly available and easily maintainable.

- Converting container images to Wolfi images, achieving smaller, more secure containers with faster boot times.

- Creation of admin tools (web-based admin application & CLI tooling) for managing database infrastructure, streamlining the process of database creation and management.

Percy.io (acquired by BrowserStack) tasked me with leading the architecture and maintenance of infrastructure for a screenshot capture & testing platform. My work involved enhancing snapshot rendering speeds and developing new customer-facing features to improve user interaction. Select work included:

- General support & maintenance of infrastructure via Helm and Terraform.

- Migrating high-traffic Redis infrastructure to TLS without skipping a beat.

- Implementing complete observability for the rendering pipeline and screenshot capture.

- Adding shadow snapshot rendering to safely upgrade the critical rendering path without image snapshot divergence.

- Developing a routing mesh and stateless snapshot rendering jobs infrastructure, leveraging Knative for efficient, containerized rendering tasks.

- Implementing high-throughput HTTPS caching for an asset-rewriting interception proxy, utilizing serverless workers for improved performance and scalability.

- Crafting browser extensions to enhance snapshot manipulation and request observation, streamlining the product functionality.

### What I’m looking for in my next role

#### Customer-centric clarity of focus

I've been working on developer tools recently, which makes customer empathy very easy. Nonetheless, I have been laser-focused on improving the customer experience for customers for years now. By focusing on eliminating paper cuts and simplifying infrastructure wherever possible, I've been aiming to increase the quality of the product while simultaneously reducing the scope of technical support & maintenance required. Soliciting direct feedback from existing customers is essential to understanding how the current product meets their needs and/or falls short.

#### Growth mindset

The single most important factor that will influence my choice of next opportunity is simply: If I can develop a track record of getting things done, does the company actively look for ways to reduce friction and help set up employees for a great outcome? Is there a great team onboarding, the best equipment and tooling, and a culture of regular feedback? Does the company encourage my growth and career trajectory?

#### Autonomy & trust

I've been able to set my own milestones and define projects for myself for the last few years, and it’s been truly liberating. It allows me to holistically approach customers’ needs and tackle the necessary infrastructure projects without being confined by a two-week iteration period. I've been managing a queue of work for myself with little guidance from my manager for a number of years now and have a proven track record of getting work done and doing it well.

#### Growing together

How teams foster discussion of differing opinions can have an outsized impact on product decisions. Fostering a culture of kindness, open communication, and straight talk is something I value in a high-functioning environment. I highly value team discussions and retrospectives to talk through what is going well and where we can improve.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss how my skills and experiences align with what you're looking for and would love the opportunity for an interview.

Thanks,

Faun
